# Full-Stack-Interactive-Exercise-Tracker
For fun I decided to make the interface look like Windows. Really poor version of Windows. 
Being able to drag and open folders.
Terminal running a "script" -> To open a Exercise Tracker.

In the exercise tracker you can add new exercises and delete them. So basically keep track of the things you've done.
 
## Project made for fun
This project has endless possibilities. I could add basically anything to it. I could add small games that you can open from the desktop.
I could add a google chrome, paint, whatever.
For now the project is in a really simple state.
